NOTE: To be able to work, SiUSBXp.DLL should be in the same folder as USBTestVBNET.exe

This file lists and describes the modifications made to the original Testpanel VB.NET code that 
is supplied with USBXpress v2.3 located in:
C:\SiLabs\MCU\USBXpress\Examples\C8051F32x\F32x_TestPanel\Host\VBNET

1. Code added to 'Form1_Load' in frmSelect.vb to check whether device is in BL mode, and if so, 
to show a message box.
2. Code from the 'Timer1_Tick' in frmMain.vb event was moved to a standalone function (SendReceive)
3. A button named 'Bootload' was added to frmMain.vb and code added for the 'Bootload_Click' event
4. Added code to 'SendReceive' in frmMain.vb that checks byte #5 in the received 'IOBuf' for &H5 
(0x05), which indicates that the device will go into BL mode. On receiving the byte, displays a 
message box and terminates the application.
5. Added code to 'SendReceive' in frmMain.vb that checks byte #6 in the received 'IOBuf' and toggles
a check button. This is to demonstrate the added functionality of Testpanel2 firmware (This byte is
always sent back as '0' by Testpanel1 firmware), thus showing that the testpanel firmware has been updated.
